            <p className="intro-copy">Georgia's state capital, steeped in history, has everything you'd want in a vibrant, growing city. From historical landmarks and museums to nationally renowned restaurants and breweries, Atlanta has something for everyone.

Take a look at a few of my favorite places, restaurants and bars, and don't forget to make a to-do list of your own.</p>
